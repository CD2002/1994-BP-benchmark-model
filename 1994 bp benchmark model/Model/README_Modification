--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Processing steps are as follows:

1.Clipping and resampling model

Origin model (you can download at https://wiki.seg.org/wiki/1994_BP_statics_benchmark_model):
    X range:     0m to 50000m  (10001 traces)
    Z range: -1500m to  4500m  (1200 samples)
    dx = dz = 5 m
Processed model:
    X range:     2500m to 24000m  (861 traces)
    Z range:     2100m to  4500m  (241 samples)
    dx = 25 m, dz = 10 m

Although the "real" dx is 25m, we set it to 10m in the numerical experiment (velocity model is same)

2.numerical processing

*Reduce the speed by half
*Set the maximum speed to 2411m/s
*Set the bottom high-speed layer(Bottom ten layers of grid) to 3000m/s

File "./truemodel.dat" shows the final model
